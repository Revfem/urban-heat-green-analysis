# Urban Heat & Green Analysis

**Urban Heat & Green Analysis** is a Machine Learning and data analysis project that explores the *Urban Heat Island (UHI)* effect and the influence of green spaces using satellite imagery and spatial datasets.

This repository contains code, models, and notebooks to preprocess data, analyze spatial relationships between vegetation and localized surface temperature, and visualize results.

## 🧠 About the Project

Urban Heat Islands are urbanized areas that experience higher temperatures than their rural surroundings due to human activities and reduced vegetation. This project aims to:

- quantify the UHI effect from satellite data,
- relate surface temperature to vegetation indices,
- build models that can predict heat distribution given green coverage levels,
- provide visualizations and maps for interpretation.

## 🗄️ Dataset

Data used in this project includes:

- Satellite imagery (e.g., thermal bands),
- Vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI),
- Urban area masks or shapefiles,
- Any related CSV or raster files.

🔗 **Datasets are shared in the Google Drive folder:**
